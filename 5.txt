NTP
---
NTP, network time protocol, was designed to syncronize time over the network.
first, there are highly accurate clocks on the first layer. these clocks have the stratum value of 0. stratum value defines the distance 
from the reference clock. 0-15 is the range which is considered reliable. any value of stratum above 15 means accuracy is not trustworthy.
the reference clocks are connected to primary time servers, which have stratum 1. udp port used is 123.


AMPLIFIED DOS ATTACKS:
----------------------
there is a command in ntp, "monlist" which sends the data of the last 600 people who requested time from this server. as the protocol works
on udp, spoofing the ip address is easy. so, for this attack, one can spoof target ip and send this command and that would send a huge 
amount of data to the target, cause a DOS. usually done as DDOS.


HOW SMARTPHONE KNOW LOCATION
-----------------------------
the location is simply found out using the formula (distance = speed of signal * time). signal is eletromagnetic so speed is speed of light.
as the speed is so high, time much be incredibly accurate to find distance. 
atomic enery is constrained to a precise set of levels, ie, if an atom jumps from one energy level to another, the energy diff is equal to a
characteristic freq, multiplied by constant (planks const.).
â–³E = hv
cesium 133 has a clock frq of 9192631770 Hz. so, 1 second is defined as that many times the oscilations of cesium 133 atom.
this provides presicion of a billionth of a second. hence, with help of a minimum of 4 satellites, and a bit of General Theory of Relativity,
the exact location can be pinpointed.
